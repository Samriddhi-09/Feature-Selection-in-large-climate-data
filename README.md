# Feature-Selection-in-large-climate-data
This project uses XGBoost for precipitation prediction and applies Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) powered by XGBoost to identify the most influential features contributing to rainfall. The aim is to improve model accuracy by selecting only the most relevant predictors from a large climate dataset.
